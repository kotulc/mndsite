# About mndsite

A portable static site renderer for publication-ready Markdown and MDX — drop it into any CI/CD pipeline as a build step.

![Content pipeline](images/pipeline.svg)


## Purpose

`mndsite` is a Next.js + Nextra-based static site renderer designed to work at the end of a markdown publishing pipeline. In the typical workflow, **mndmap** organizes source markdown, enriches frontmatter, rewrites links and assets, and emits a destination directory; `mndsite` mirrors that tree, builds navigation, and produces a `dist/` folder. Publishing is left to the caller.

Raw markdown directories also work when content is already publication-ready — the same YAML config and CLI apply.

The engine is packaged as a Docker image: mount your content and config, get a static site.


## Pipeline split

```text
source Markdown/MDX
  → mndmap (optional — organization, metadata, assets, nav_order)
  → destination directory + mndsite.yaml
  → mndsite ingest + build
  → dist/
```

| Concern | Owner |
|---------|--------|
| Folder/group organization, destination layout | **mndmap** |
| Internal link and asset rewriting | **mndmap** |
| Description, reading time, tags, related links (when generated) | **mndmap** / frontmatter |
| Emitted `nav_order` and `content` paths | **mndmap** |
| `.md` → `.mdx` adaptation, Nextra integration | **mndsite** |
| Navigation UI, theme, metadata presentation | **mndsite** |
| Static export, Docker packaging, deployment docs | **mndsite** |

mndsite does not run embedding models, synthesize tags, score related pages, flatten directories, or apply a second organization policy.


## How It Works

1. Prepare a content directory (from mndmap or your own markdown tree)
2. Provide an `mndsite.yaml` config pointing at that content
3. Run the CLI or Docker container to ingest and build
4. A fully-built static site appears in your output directory

See [Getting Started](/getting-started) to have a site running in minutes,
or browse the [Features](/features) section for the full capability overview.


## Features

- **Markdown → MDX** — automatic conversion; mirrors any folder structure without regrouping
- **MDX and inline SVG** — publication-ready MDX and diagrams preserved from upstream
- **`_assets/` handoff** — static assets copied to `public/_assets/` with path rewriting
- **Images** — legacy `images/` subtrees copied and path-rewritten; corrupt EXIF stripped
- **Reading time** — displayed when supplied in frontmatter
- **Facets** — any declared frontmatter dimension rendered as colored chips and (future) sidebar filters
- **Breadcrumbs and Contents panel** — configurable via `display.crumbs` and `display.contents`
- **Related links** — outbound links and frontmatter `related` entries in the ToC sidebar
- **Nav ordering** — sibling order via `nav_order` from mndmap or YAML
- **Custom components** — optional consumer React components synced each build
- **Theme toggle** — light / dark / system toggle in the navbar
- **GitHub header icon** — circular GitHub repo link, auto-shown from `repo_url`
- **YAML config** — single file drives rendering and deployment
- **Docker** — packaged as a container for use in any CI/CD pipeline


## Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Core renderer** *(complete)*
- Next.js + Nextra docs theme
- YAML config + CLI wrapper
- Docker image, GHCR publishing
- GitHub Pages deployment
- Configurable `display`, `fields`, and `facets` in `mndsite.yaml`
- mndmap destination fixture contract
- Nav ordering via `nav_order`

**Phase 2 — Custom components** *(planned)*
- Semantic search integration (signals from upstream pipeline)
- Semantic theming pipeline
- Reduced external dependencies

**Phase 3 — Deploy adapters** *(planned)*
- `mndsite deploy --provider vercel|cloudflare|s3`
- Credentials via environment variables; project ID via YAML
